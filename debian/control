Description: Internet Suspend/Resume (ISR) client
 OpenISR is the latest implementation of Internet Suspend/Resume, which 
 combines a virtual machine with distributed storage to provide the user 
 with both mobility and consistent state without the need for mobile hardware.
 This package contains a client (isr), a parcel manager (Vulpes), a wrapper 
 library for VMware (libvdisk), and the source to the openisr kernel module 
 (Nexus).  A virtual machine monitor (VMware, Xen, KVM, etc) should also be 
 installed.   OpenISR is developed at Carnegie Mellon University.
