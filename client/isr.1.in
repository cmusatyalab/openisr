.SH DESCRIPTION
An Internet Suspend/Resume (ISR) system is a collection of
virtual machine
.I parcels
in a 
.I remote store 
consisting of a collection of 
.I content servers, 
a well-known 
.I nameserver
that contains location information about each parcel, and a 
set of 
.I client hosts,
each loaded with the 
.B isr
client program and a 
.I virtual machine monitor.  
A parcel is a file tree that represents all of the state of some
virtual machine in execution.  The remote store maintains checkpointed
versions of each parcel.

Each ISR user has a unique
.I ISR userid
and a corresponding 
.I ISR password
on the nameserver.
Distinct ISR userids own disjoint sets of parcels. Parcels are not
shared across ISR userids. At any point in time, a parcel can be
checked out on at most one client host. A simple locking mechanism
enforces this policy.


The 
.B isr
client program provides commands to 
.I checkout 
(download) parcels from the remote
store to the client host, 
run parcels on the client host, 
.I checkin 
(upload) parcels from the client
host back to the remote store, query the status of parcels,
authenticate to the ISR system, and change the ISR password.
Downloading and running a parcel is known as 
.I resuming
the parcel. 
Locally suspending the virtual machine monitor 
and then uploading the parcel back
to the server is known as
.I suspending
the parcel.

The 
.B isr
client program also provides a command to
.B hoard
parcel state into a persistent 
.I hoard cache
on the client host.
Each parcel has its own separate hoard cache. 
A fully-hoarded parcel contains the entire virtual disk state 
in its hoard cache, and thus can be
resumed
.I disconnected,
without a network connection. Use the 
.B stat
command to view the state of a parcel's hoard cache on your client. 

You can safely attempt to interrupt any
.B isr
command at any time by typing control-c (SIGINT).  Regions of commands
that should not be interrupted will ignore these SIGINT signals.

On a particular client host, the
.I default nameserver
is given by the 
.I nameserver 
variable in 
.IR !!SHAREDIR!!/config ,
which may be overridden in the system config file in
.I !!SYSCONFDIR!!/openisr.conf
or the user config file in
.IR ~/.openisr.conf .
If necessary, however, the nameserver can be specified on
the command line using the
.B -n 
command line option.

By default, the 
.I current ISR userid
is the current Unix login name. This can be overridden by 
setting the
.I userid
config option in 
.I !!SYSCONFDIR!!/openisr.conf
or
.IR ~/.openisr.conf ,
which in turn can be overridden by specifying the  
.B -u
option on the command line.

.SH COMMANDS 

.TP
.BI "isr auth"
Authenticate to the ISR servers. You will be prompted for your ISR
password.  Run this command once, at the beginning of each X session
to avoid having to keep typing your ISR password.


.TP
.BI "isr checkin(ci) " parcel " [-b " "KBytes/s" "]"
Checkin a 
.I parcel 
to the remote store. This command creates a new checkpointed version
of the parcel in the remote store, and then releases a lock on the
parcel so that it can be resumed by other client hosts.
The 
.BI -b 
.I KBytes/s
option limits the upload bandwidth to 
.I KBytes/s.

The
.B checkin
command is 
.I idempotent, 
meaning that it can be safely interrupted with ctrl-c and rerun until
it successfully completes.

.TP
.BI "isr checkout(co) " "parcel" " [-r " "oldversion" "]"
Download  a 
.I parcel 
from the remote store without running it. 
The
.B -r
option allows you to rollback to previous parcel versions, 
as described in the documentation for the 
.B resume
command. The 
.B checkout
command is normally subsumed by the 
.B resume 
command. However, it can be useful in some situations.
For example, you might want to 
use the 
.B stat
command (which requires the parcel to be checked out) 
before you actually run the parcel.


.TP
.BI "isr checkp " "parcel" " [-r " "version" "] [-c]" 
This is a debugging command that checks a 
.I version
of a 
.I parcel 
on the server for consistency. Checks the most recent version
by default. The 
.B -c
option performs an additional (and time-consuming) content consistency
check.

.TP
.BI "isr clean " "parcel" " [-a]"
Remove  
.I parcel 
from the client host and forcibly release its
server lock. The 
.B -a
option removes 
.I all 
local parcel state, including any persistent state in the parcel's
hoard cache. This command can be used to release the lock on a parcel
from any machine, which is handy if you've forgotten to checkin the
parcel and want to use it from another machine.

.TP
.BI "isr deauth" 
Remove the authentication credentials that were established by the
.B auth
command.

.TP
.BI "isr discard " "parcel"
Discard all local client changes to 
.I parcel 
since the last 
.B checkout
or 
.B sync.  
This command can be useful for speeding up the
.B checkin 
command after brief ISR sessions where you don't need to save any of
the changes you made. It is also useful for "micro-rollbacks" that allow 
you to recover from mistakes during the current session. For example, 
if you inadvertently type "rm -rf /bin" as root in the guest, the
.B
discard 
command will allow you to rollback to the parcel that existed at the time
of the most recent 
.B
checkout 
or
.B
sync
command.

.TP
.BI "isr disconnect " "parcel" " [-x]"
Prepare the host client so that it can safely 
.B resume 
.I parcel 
disconnected from the network. You should always run this command before
attempting to resume a parcel in disconnected mode.  By default, the
.B disconnect 
command is somewhat conservative, performing a lengthy internal
consistency check of the hoard cache. You can skip the consistency
check with the
.B -x
option. 

.TP
.BI "isr help"
Display a brief usage summary.

.TP
.BI "isr hoard " "parcel"
Fetch the parcel's entire virtual disk into the parcel's 
.I hoard cache
on the client. This command
fetches only the blocks that are missing on the client. You can kill
it with
.B ctrl-c
and rerun it as many times as you wish without any ill effects. 

You can hoard a parcel anytime and anywhere, even if other
.B isr 
commands are currently running, and even if the parcel is not
currently checked out on the client host.

.TP
.BI "isr ls [" parcel "] [-l|-L " "n" "]"
List information about your parcels. By default, this command displays
the status of all of the user's parcels that are managed by the
default nameserver. The display identifies the nameserver, and then for
each parcel, prints a single line with the name, the location of the
content server in the remote store, the current lock status
.I (acquired 
or 
.I released), 
the user and client host that last changed the lock status, and the
time of that change.  

If a specific parcel is named on the command line, only information
about that parcel will be shown.  The 
.B -L
option requests a long listing format, printing 
additional information about the 
.I n
most recent parcel versions.
The 
.B -l 
option is similar, printing information for some
small default number of the most recent versions.


.TP
.BI "isr passwd" 
Change your ISR password.
This command does 
.B NOT 
change the password of the Unix login
account on your client host. (Use the local
.B passwd
command for that.)  

.TP
.BI "isr reset"
This command resets the ISR runtime.
If the client gets into an inconsistent state, try this command
before rebooting.
  
.TP
.BI "isr resume " "parcel" " [-r " "oldversion" "] [-dX]"
Checkout a 
.I parcel
(if necessary) and then run it. 
This command acquires a lock on the parcel and
downloads the minimum amount of virtual machine state needed to
run the parcel on the client host. Any additional state that the parcel
needs while it is running will be demand paged from the remote store.

By default, the 
.B resume
command downloads the most recent parcel
version. However, you can rollback to previous parcel versions using
the
.BI -r 
.I oldversion
option. Let 
.I lastversion
be the most recent parcel version on the remote store. Then
.B -r 
.I oldversion
causes the remote store to first create a new version
.I lastversion+1
that is an identical copy  of version
.IR oldversion .
This new version, which is now the most recent version, 
is then downloaded as before. 

By default, the 
.B resume 
command requires a network connection. 
However, if the parcel is fully
.B hoarded
then you can use the 
.B -d
option to resume
.IR disconnected .
Running the 
.B disconnect
or
.B hoard
commands before resuming disconnected will ensure that 
the parcel is fully hoarded. 


The 
.B -X 
option is useful for configuring the virtual machine monitor,
landing control in the virtual machine monitor when the
the parcel is resumed and suspended.

.TP
.BI "isr stat " parcel " [-c]"
Display information about the local state of a 
.IR parcel ,
such as the amount of state demand paged from the remote
store, the amount of dirty state, the amount of state that
is hoarded in the persistent hoard cache. The 
.B -c
option will also check the consistency of the local 
cache and the hoard cache. The
.I parcel
must be checked out in order to use the
.B stat
command.

.TP
.BI "isr sync " parcel " [-b " "KBytes/s" "]"
Save a new checkpointed version of 
.I 
parcel 
in the remote store, without releasing the lock or 
.B discarding 
any of the current local state. You can
.B sync
as often as you like between 
.B resume
commands. 
The 
.BI -b 
.I KBytes/s
option limits the upload bandwidth to 
.IR KBytes/s .

The
.B sync
command is 
.IR idempotent , 
meaning that it can be safely interrupted with ctrl-c and rerun until
it successfully completes.


.TP
.BI "isr version"
Display the version of the ISR client.

.SH OPTIONS
Each option has equivalent short and long forms.
.TP
.B -a/--allstate
Remove all parcel state, including any persistent state in the 
hoard cache, during the
.B clean
command. 

.TP
.BI -b/--bwlimit " KBytes/s"
Limit upload bandwidth 
during
.B checkin
and 
.B sync
to 
.IR KBytes/s .


.TP
.B -c/--checkstate
Perform an additional content consistency check during the 
.B stat
and 
.B checkparcel
commands.

.TP
.B -d/--disconnected
.B Resume
disconnected (after hoarding).

.TP
.B -l/--long
Use long listing format for the 
.B ls
command, printing information about some small default 
number of the most recent parcel versions.

.TP
.BI -L/--longvers " n"
Use long listing format for the 
.B ls
command, printing information about the 
.I n
most recent parcel versions.

.TP
.BI -n/--nameserver " name"
Use the nameserver 
.IR name ,
overriding the default.
.I name
can be a fully qualified domain name or an IP address.

.TP
.B -q/--quiet
Run silently (except if things go wrong).

.TP
.BI -r/--rollback " version"
Optional parcel version number for the 
.BR checkout , " resume" ", and " checkp
commands. For 
.BR checkout " and " resume
it determines the parcel
.I version 
to rollback to. For
.B checkp
it determines the parcel
.I version
to check for consistency.

.TP
.BI -u/--user " userid"
By default, the current ISR userid is the current Unix login name
or the value of the
.I userid
variable from the configuration files.  This
option overrides both of these and sets the current ISR userid to
.IR userid .

.TP
.B -v/--verbose
Increment the verbosity level. 

.TP
.B -x/--nocheckstate
This option speeds up the 
.B disconnect
command by skipping the lengthy internal consistency check
of the hoard cache. 

It is provided as a debugging option to the
.B sync
and 
.B ci
commands, in which case it skips the content consistency check
of a parcel before and after a new version is committed to the server.

.TP
.B -X/--noauto
When the parcel is resumed, control lands in the virtual machine monitor
instead of the parcel.
This is a debugging option that is not intended for everyday use.

.SH EXAMPLES

In the following, suppose that your Unix login name is 
.I isruser
and that your ISR userid is 
.IR bovik .
Here is how you might use
.B isr
during a typical day: 

After arriving at work, you login to your ISR client host using the
Linux login name
.I isruser
and then start up X windows. Next, you will need to 
authenticate to the ISR servers,

.RS
\fCisruser> isr auth\fP
.RE

which prompts you for your ISR password.  You are now authenticated
and will not need to type this password again until you either explicitly
.B deauth
or terminate the X session.  

After listing your available parcels,

.RS
\fCisruser> isr ls\fP
.RE

you decide to resume the Windows parcel called 
.I winxp
in connected mode:

.RS
\fCisruser> isr resume winxp\fP
.RE

This downloads parcel
.I winxp
(if necessary)
and executes it inside the virtual machine monitor (VMM).

After running the parcel all morning, you realize you need to head out
to a lunch meeting in a conference room with poor wireless
connectivity. So you suspend the current running parcel, which causes
the VMM to return control to the Linux shell.  After making sure that
it is safe to run disconnected (i.e., your parcel state is hoarded), 

.RS
\fCisruser> isr disconnect winxp -x\fP
.RE

you unplug the network cable, carry your laptop to the noon meeting, 
and then run you parcel disconnected during the meeting:

.RS
\fCisruser> isr resume winxp -d\fP
.RE

After the meeting, you head back to the office, plug your network
cable back in, and create a checkpointed version of your current
parcel state on the remote store:

.RS
\fCisruser> isr sync winxp\fP
.RE

After running connected for the rest of the day, it's time to head
home. So you terminate the ISR session by checking in your parcel:

.RS
\fCisruser> isr ci winxp\fP
.RE

Once home, you login to your home ISR client, authenticate to the ISR
servers, and then checkout the parcel that you were working on at work:

.RS
\fCisruser> isr resume winxp\fP
.RE
