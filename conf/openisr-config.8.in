.SH NAME
openisr-config - build and install the OpenISR kernel modules

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B openisr-config

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B openisr-config
is a helper program to build and install the kernel modules for the client
part of the OpenISR\*(Tm system.  Depending on your installation method, you
may need to run this command to complete the installation of the OpenISR
client.  In addition, you must run this command after a kernel upgrade
in order to build modules for your new kernel.
.BR isr (1)
will tell you when you need to do this.

After the modules are built and installed,
.B openisr-config
will load them into the running kernel.  Therefore, you do not need to reboot
after running this command.

.B openisr-config
will unload any previously-loaded OpenISR modules.  If the modules cannot be
unloaded, perhaps because a parcel is currently resumed on this host, the
program will abort.

This program must be run as root.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B openisr-config
returns 0 on success and 1 on failure.

.SH BUGS
There is no way to tell
.B openisr-config
to build modules against a kernel other than the one currently running.
