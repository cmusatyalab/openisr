# Configuration file for OpenISR client
#
# This file is distributed with the OpenISR client, and changes made here
# will be lost whenever the client is upgraded.  Configuration entries placed
# in /etc/openisr/openisr.conf or ~/.openisrrc will override these defaults.

# Default server domain name (override with -s)
server = endurance.isr.cs.cmu.edu

# Default userid (override with -u)
# If this variable is undefined or empty, then it defaults to the Unix
# login name
userid = 

# Top-level directory for ISR data.  Valid escape sequences:
# \u - Local username
# \h - User's home directory
isrdir = \h/.isr

# To override the default command used to start a particular VMM, provide an
# entry of the form "<vmm>.command = <command>".

# Parcelkeeper logging mask
logmask = info,error,stats,slow

# Parcelkeeper console logging mask

# How many seconds should elapse before we decide the client is unconnected
connect_timeout = 10

# How many seconds should elapse before we restart a failed hoard operation
hoard_sleep = 5

# How many times to retry if a read or write request fails

# By default, how many of the most recent versions should "ls -l" display
ls_versions = 5

# How hard we should try to compress newly-generated disk chunks (at runtime)
# and memory images (at checkin/sync).
#
# Recognized values:
#   disabled	- Do not compress at all.  This is intended for debugging
#		  purposes only; "mild" will almost always perform better.
#   mild	- Use a very fast algorithm which compresses poorly.  Choose
#		  this option to improve runtime performance if you have a
#		  LAN-speed connection to the server.
#   moderate	- Use an algorithm which is reasonably good and reasonably
#		  fast.  Choose this option for intermediate-bandwidth
#		  connections such as fast broadband.
#   painful	- Attempt to compress as much as possible, and spend a lot
#		  of time doing it.  This option is appropriate for very slow
#		  links.
#
# These values currently correspond to the following compression algorithms:
#
# Setting		Chunk compression	Memory image compression
# disabled		none			none
# mild			LZF			LZF
# moderate		zlib			gzip
# painful		zlib			LZMA
#
# Note, however, that these mappings may change in the future.  Older
# parcels may not be configured to support all of these algorithms; in this
# case, the closest match will be used.
