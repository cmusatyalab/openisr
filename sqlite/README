We build against our own copy of SQLite rather than using the one installed
on the host system.  This allows us to use newer interfaces and avoid having
to work around data corruption bugs in older versions of SQLite, and gives us
a more predictable runtime environment.

We use "the amalgamation", a single C file which contains the entire SQLite
implementation, as provided by the official download site at sqlite.org.

We use libtool's -release option when linking, to ensure that we don't
accidentally fall back to the system library if our copy isn't installed.
(It also prevents OpenISR programs which use SQLite from having to do
explicit version checks at runtime, in case an older version of ISR SQLite
is still installed.)  When updating sqlite3.[ch] to a new version, remember to
update Makefile.am as well.
