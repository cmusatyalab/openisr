We build against our own copy of SQLite rather than using the one installed
on the host system.  This allows us to avoid handling behavior changes across
SQLite releases (including data corruption bugs) and gives us a more
predictable runtime environment.

We use "the amalgamation", a single C file which contains the entire SQLite
implementation, as provided by the official download site at sqlite.org.
