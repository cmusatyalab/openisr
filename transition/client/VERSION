=== ISR-3 client is no longer supported ===

ISR-3 is no longer under active development.  Please consider upgrading to the
client for the new OpenISR system; this client is backward-compatible with
existing parcels.  The new client provides much higher reliability and
compatibility with newer Linux kernels, and works with kernel versions 2.6.8
and above.

The automatic update system is no longer supported.  To upgrade to the new
client, uninstall ISR-3 and then install the new client, which may be obtained
from <http://isr.cmu.edu/>.  Saying "y" when prompted to upgrade will cause the
current checkout or resume operation to be cancelled; say "n" to continue the
checkout or resume operation.

If you wish to prevent this message from being displayed in the future, remove
the "VERSION" file from your ISR installation directory.

Please contact isr@cs.cmu.edu if you have any questions.
