- Fix kernel crash triggerable by any local user
- Fix rare deadlock on single-core, non-HT machines
- Dramatically reduce Vulpes' CPU utilization
- Add support for 2.6.23 kernel
- Add support for running VMware on 64-bit hosts
- Add AES support to Nexus
- Add support for external "dirtometer" program
- Add openisr-config script to build and install the OpenISR kernel modules
- Show a progress bar while encoding/decoding a memory image
- Various improvements to handling of parcel memory image
- Improve handling of loop device unbinding at suspend time
- Fix client-commit and resume failures after a VMware crash with newer
  versions of VMware
- Fix bug which could cause a stale memory image to be used after a parcel
  was shut down
- Print a warning on resume if the loaded Nexus module is out-of-date
- Various fixes and performance improvements
- Packaging updates

====== 0.8.3 (2007-07-11)

- Fix deadlock under high I/O load with large guest memory image
- Fix kernel oops occurring with some kernel builds (e.g. Fedora Core 5) after
  Nexus block device shutdown.  As a side effect, Nexus is no longer unloadable
  on 2.6.10 and 2.6.11.
- Fix hang of "isr" command on 32-bit Ubuntu 7.04 systems
- Add support for kernels 2.6.21 and 2.6.22
- Improve performance of client commit phase of "isr checkin"
- Automatically load the loop driver at boot
- Packaging updates
- Minor fixes

====== 0.8.2 (2007-04-16)

- Fix memory leak in Nexus kernel module.  After upgrading to 0.8.2, you should
  reboot your system to free up leaked memory.
- Fix race condition when performing checkouts on multiple parcels at once,
  potentially leading to nonce mismatches at checkin
- Fix loop device leak when running multiple parcels simultaneously.  This
  could eventually cause Vulpes to refuse to start until loop devices were
  manually deallocated.
- Compile fixes for some Linux distributions
- Documentation updates

====== 0.8.1 (2007-03-15)

- Improve efficiency of zlib compression/decompression
- Add optimized SHA-1 implementation for x86-64 architecture
- Add support for kernel 2.6.20
- Add "nexus_debug" helper program to list/show/set Nexus debug bits
- Convert build system to GNU Autotools
- Improve performance of "isr stat"
- Improve reliability of "isr disconnect"
- Allow the checkout process to be cancelled with ctrl-C during memory image
  download
- Add support for null encryption in Nexus and its test harness
- Eliminate "hostid" per-system unique identifier.  Upgrades from 0.8 will
  retain the identifier in /etc/openisr/hostid, but it will be ignored.
- Improved documentation
- Minor fixes

====== 0.8 (2007-02-15)

- First release of OpenISR
