====== 0.9-pre (2007-12-03)

------ Headlines

- Significant server API changes.  0.9-series clients will not work with
  older servers, and vice versa.  Parcels created for older versions of ISR
  will need to be converted to 0.9 format before they can be used with an
  0.9 server.
- The distinction between nameservers and content servers has been eliminated;
  each parcel is now associated with exactly one server.
- The client has a new hoard cache implementation which significantly reduces
  the need to download data more than once, even across parcels.

------ Parcel format changes

- Parcel data is now encrypted with the AES algorithm instead of Blowfish.
- Replace redundant ASCII and binary keyring files with a new, SQLite-based
  keyring
- Eliminate index.lev1 file and fold its contents into parcel.cfg
- Session logs are now per-parcel rather than per-user.  Actions which do
  not apply to a specific parcel are logged to the per-parcel log of every
  parcel known to the client.
- Each parcel now has a UUID which uniquely identifies that parcel
- The layout of the ~/.isr directory on the client has changed significantly

------ Client changes

- Checkouts and hoard caches created by OpenISR 0.8.4 and earlier will not
  be recognized by this version.  At resume time, the client will warn about
  any old-style checkouts, and will offer to delete old-style hoard caches to
  free up disk space.
- Replace Vulpes with Parcelkeeper, a near-complete rewrite
- Always copy disk chunks, keyrings, and memory images to the hoard cache
  after downloading, eliminating redundant downloads
- Eliminate extra copy of memory image on the first resume after checkout,
  at the cost of a slower "isr discard"
- Dramatically improve the performance of "isr ls"
- Significantly clean up logging format for enhanced readability
- Add experimental support for LZF compression
- Add low-level infrastructure for VMM independence
- Rename the Nexus "zap" sysfs action to "kill" to clarify the destructive
  nature of the action
- No longer zero the Nexus "state_times" counters when the sysfs attribute is
  read.  Writing a string to the attribute file will zero the counters.
- Eliminate or reduce several logging races
- Miscellaneous fixes and cleanups

------ "isr" command line

- Add new hoard cache management commands: lshoard, rmhoard, checkhoard
- Rename -n/--nameserver option to -s/--server
- Rename -X/--noauto option to -F/--no-fullscreen
- Eliminate "clean -a"; use rmhoard instead
- Eliminate broken (and dangerous) "reset" command
- Eliminate "-p" option, which was accepted and ignored in 0.8
- Eliminate "checkparcel" command, which was just an alias for "checkp"
- Move server-side parcel validation from "checkp" to "checkp -e"
- Move local cache validation from "stat -c" to "checkp"
- Move hoard cache validation from "stat -c" to "checkhoard"
- "checkp" and "checkhoard" will not validate the hashes of stored disk
  chunks unless the -c/--checkstate option is provided
- Eliminate "disconnect"; use "checkout -d"/"resume -d" instead.
  "checkout -d" is now an alias for checkout + hoard, and "resume -d" will
  invoke "hoard" if the parcel is not fully hoarded.
- Eliminate -x/--nocheckstate; the functionality it was bypassing is now
  mandatory for checkin/sync and is no longer the default in other cases.
  When passing -d/--disconnected to checkout and resume, you can pass
  -c/--checkstate to get the old "disconnect" behavior.
- Allow a parcel's UUID to be used on the command line in place of its name
  if the parcel is currently checked out

------ Client configuration

- Read per-user config file from ~/.openisrrc instead of ~/.openisr.conf
- Rename "nameserver" config option to "server"
- Change format of "logmask"/"console_logmask" options: instead of a bitmask,
  these now take a comma-separated list of log types.  Currently accepted
  types are: none, info, error, chunk, transport, query, slow.
- Add "compression" option, which specifies the compression algorithm to
  be used for newly written disk chunks
- Add "hoard_minsize" option, which specifies the hoard cache size (in MB)
  below which no chunks will be garbage-collected from the cache
- Add "disable_lookaside" debug option; set this to "1" to force re-downloading
  of the keyring and memory image at checkout

------ Significant client bugfixes

- Permit a server-side checkparcel operation concurrently with other parcel
  operations (such as resume)
- Disallow sync/checkin if we no longer hold the parcel lock
- No longer allow running in disconnected mode if the local cache is fully
  populated but the hoard cache is not, since this could cause "isr discard"
  to have unexpected side effects
- Properly handle simultaneous checkouts of parcels with the same userid and
  parcel name, but different servers

------ Server changes

- Ship the server code in the source tarball; the server can be installed by
  passing --enable-server to configure.
- Allow the server modules to be installed anywhere in the filesystem, so long
  as the new "isr_runserv" wrapper script is in the PATH
- Add a script, upgrade-0.9.pl, which will read an ISR-3 or OpenISR 0.8 parcel
  and write out a new one in OpenISR 0.9 format
- Improve the thoroughness of the checkparcel module
- Various performance improvements

------ isr_admin changes

- All isr_admin commands should now work properly
- Simplify isr_admin's command-line syntax
- Add "isr_admin makeparcel" command to create an empty parcel from scratch

------ Server configuration

- The message-of-the-day file is now located at /etc/openisr/motd
- cfg tarballs included in parcels generated with "isr_admin makeparcel" will
  be pre-populated from the contents of the /etc/openisr/skel directory,
  if it exists
- Server.pm no longer contains system-specific configuration information.
  That data has been moved to a new config file, /etc/openisr/locksrv.conf,
  which contains "key = value" pairs.  Default values will be chosen if
  locksrv.conf is missing or does not contain a particular key.
- Add "content_root" config option to locksrv.conf, giving the path to the
  HTTP document root
- Add "default_pass" config option, giving the password that will be assigned
  to user accounts created by isr_admin
- Add "hostname" config option, giving the server hostname that should be
  written to parcel.cfg files generated by isr_admin

------ Significant server bugfixes

- Don't create world-readable, unencrypted keyrings in the webroot
- Don't set execute bits on chunk and image files during commit
- Allow checkparcel on a version != 1 which has no predecessors (i.e., a parcel
  that has been pruned)
- Don't allow a client to commit or rollback a parcel unless the client
  holds a valid nonce
- Avoid potential data corruption if multiple clients try to upload a checkin
  at the same time (due to a stolen parcel lock)
- Avoid exposing a parcel's keyroot to other users of the server system
- Generate each new parcel with a unique keyroot
- Significantly improve the entropy in generated keyroots
