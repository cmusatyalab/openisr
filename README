To build from a source tarball:
- All of the requirements for running the OpenISR system, plus:

  liblzma, and libfuse
- pkg-config

This release ships with an updated version of the ISR-3 server software.
Future releases will include a completely new server implementation.

INSTALLATION SUMMARY
--------------------

./autogen.sh      # Only if building from the Git repository
./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
make
make install      # As root

VIRTUAL MACHINE MONITORS
------------------------

The OpenISR system currently includes drivers for the following virtual
machine monitors.  The name of the driver is listed in parentheses.

- VirtualBox >= 3.0.2 (virtualbox)

- KVM (kvm)

- VMware Workstation and VMware Player (vmware)
	Newly created parcels for these VMMs require VMware Workstation 6.0
	or greater, or VMware Player 2.0 or greater.  Legacy parcels may work
	with older versions of VMware.

- Shell (shell)
	This is a stub VMM driver that merely launches a shell.  It can be
	used for debugging, or to run a VMM for which a VMM driver does not
	currently exist.  This driver is always built and installed unless
	--disable-client is specified to configure, and is not affected
	by the setting of --enable-vmm-drivers.

- Dummy VMM (none)
	This is a stub VMM driver that merely waits for the invoking ISR
	client program to receive SIGINT, and then shuts down.  It can be
	used by wrapper scripts to obtain access to a parcel's disk under
	program control.  This driver is always built and installed unless
	--disable-client is specified to configure, and is not affected
	by the setting of --enable-vmm-drivers.

CONFIGURE OPTIONS
-----------------

Aside from the standard options, the OpenISR configure script supports the
following command line options:

--with-zlib=DIR
--with-curl=DIR
--with-libarchive=DIR
	Specifies an additional search path for zlib, curl, or libarchive,
	respectively.  In addition to the specified paths, configure will
	check a set of default paths for each component.

--disable-client
	Do not build or install components that are only used by the OpenISR
	client.

--enable-vmm-drivers=<list>
--disable-vmm-drivers
	List of VMM drivers to build and install, or --disable-vmm-drivers
	not to build any.  The default is to build and install all supported
	VMM drivers unless --disable-client is specified, in which case no
	drivers are built.  <list> is a comma-separated list of VMM driver
	names (virtualbox, kvm, etc.).  The special driver name "all" enables
	all supported VMM drivers.  A driver name may be prefixed with the "-"
	character to prevent building that driver; for example,
	--enable-vmm-drivers=all,-vmware will build every driver except vmware.
	The "shell" driver is always built and installed unless
	--disable-client is specified, and is not affected by this option.

--enable-server
	Build and install components that are used by the OpenISR server.

INSTALLATION PATHS
------------------

By default, the OpenISR bash completion rules are installed in a subdirectory
of $prefix/etc.  However, most systems only look for such files in
subdirectories of /etc.  To solve this problem, you can pass
"--sysconfdir=/etc" to configure, or you can move the rules file into /etc
by hand.

During the build process, several pieces of the OpenISR system are configured
to expect helper programs and data files in the locations specified to
configure.  However, it is possible to install the OpenISR system to a
different directory, though ISR will not work if it is run directly from
there.  (You might want to do this while building a binary package, for
example.)  To install to an alternate directory, set the DESTDIR environment
variable to its absolute path when running "make install".

COMPONENTS AND THEIR LICENSES
-----------------------------

The OpenISR system is composed of several components, licensed under several
different software licenses.  Here is a short summary of each component:

User interface
	This is the "isr" command-line client, and is licensed under the
	Eclipse Public License, version 1.0.  The code for this component
	can be found in the "client" directory of the source tree.

Parcelkeeper
	This program manages the virtual disk provided by the OpenISR system
	to guest VMs.  It is responsible for maintenance of the parcel
	keyring, local cache, and hoard cache; runtime communication with
	the server; and various maintenance tasks.  Parcelkeeper is launched
	by the user interface code when necessary; most users will never need
	to start it directly.  Parcelkeeper is licensed under version 2 of
	the GNU General Public License.

locksrv
	This is the server component of the OpenISR system.  It includes
	the programs implementing the server API, as well as a program
	to perform various administrative tasks.  It can be found in the
	"locksrv" directory of the source tree, and is licensed under the
	Eclipse Public License, version 1.0.

Miscellaneous tools
	The "tools" directory contains a set of command-line tools used by
	the client and/or server.  The programs found there are licensed
	under the GNU General Public License, version 2.

libisrcrypto
	This is a library containing implementations of various cryptographic
	algorithms.  The ISR user-space components use this library to perform
	cryptography.  It is licensed under version 2.1 of the GNU Lesser
	General Public License and can be found in the "crypto" subdirectory.

libisrsql
	This is a library which provides an embedded SQL database engine.
	It includes an embedded copy of the third-party SQLite database
	library, but does not export any SQLite symbols.  libisrsql is
	licensed under version 2 of the GNU General Public License, and can
	be found in the "sqlite" directory of the source tree.

libisrutil
	This is a utility library used by other parts of the OpenISR system.
	It is licensed under version 2 of the GNU General Public License
	and can be found in the "libutil" directory of the source tree.

VMM drivers and support code
	These are driver programs and associated support code which allow the
	OpenISR client to interact with specific virtual machine monitors.
	They are found in the "vmm" directory of the source tree, and are
	licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2.
