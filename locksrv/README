ISR Remote Storage and Name Server Directory

This directory contains two types of programs: those that run on the
name server (isr_nsrv_*), and those that implement the basic ISR
operations on parcels in remote storage (isr_srv_*).

Each program takes a -h command line argument that prints help info.

Files:
README
	This file

isr_admin
	Tool to perform various administrative functions.

Server.pm	
	Perl module imported by each program that exports  
	configuration variables and common functions.

isr_nsrv_getconfig.pl	
	Returns the contents of parcel.cfg via stdout. 

isr_nsrv_listparcels.pl	
	Lists the parcels managed by this name server for a particular user.

isr_nsrv_motd.pl
	Prints the message of the day from /usr/local/isr/motd.txt.

isr_srv_catlog.pl 
	Appends a temporary session log to a user's permanent ISR log

isr_srv_checkparcel.pl 
	Checks a parcel and its predecessor for internal consistency.

isr_srv_commit.pl
	Commits the contents of a temporary parcel cache that was 
	produced by a checkpoint or a rollback to a new version. In
	general this program is not idempotent. We expect it to run
	to completion without any errors.
                         
isr_srv_lock.pl
	Acquires, releases, or checks a parcel lock.
	
isr_srv_ls.pl
	Lists information about a particular parcel.

isr_srv_resetcache.pl
	Creates an empty parcel cache in remote storage.

isr_srv_rollback.pl
	Creates a new (last) parcel version that is identical to some
	previous version. For example, if the current version
	is v6, a rollback to v2 will create a new v7 that is 
	identical to v2 when it was checked in.

isr_srv_stat.pl
	Returns the stat entries for a file as a set of
	"key=value" pairs (one per line) on stdout. The keys
	are DEV, INO, SIZE, MODE, NLINK, UID, GID, RDEV, SIZE,
	ATIME, MTIME, CTIME, BLKSSIZE, BLOCKS, and SHA1.
