ISR Server Directory

This directory contains the components that implement ISR operations on
parcels in remote storage.

Each component takes a -h command line argument that prints help info.

	This file

Server.pm	
	Perl module that exports common functions.

isr_admin
	Administration tool which creates and deletes user accounts,
	creates parcels, and does other miscellaneous tasks.

isr_runserv
	Wrapper script, placed in the user's PATH, which loads and
	runs one of the below modules (specified in its first argument).

srv_catlog.pm 
	Appends a temporary session log to a user's permanent ISR log.

srv_checkparcel.pm 
	Checks a parcel and its predecessor for internal consistency.

srv_commit.pm
	Commits the contents of a temporary parcel cache that was 
	produced by a checkpoint or a rollback to a new version. In
	general this program is not idempotent. We expect it to run
	to completion without any errors.

srv_getconfig.pm	
	Returns the contents of parcel.cfg via stdout. 

srv_lock.pm
	Acquires, releases, or checks a parcel lock.

srv_ls.pm
	Lists information about all of a user's parcels, or about a
	particular parcel.

srv_motd.pm
	Prints the message of the day, if any.

srv_rollback.pm
	Creates a new (last) parcel version that is identical to some
	previous version. For example, if the current version
	is v6, a rollback to v2 will create a new v7 that is 
	identical to v2 when it was checked in.

srv_stat.pm
	Returns the stat entries for a file as a set of
	"key=value" pairs (one per line) on stdout. The keys
	are DEV, INO, SIZE, MODE, NLINK, UID, GID, RDEV, SIZE,
	ATIME, MTIME, CTIME, BLKSSIZE, BLOCKS, and SHA1.
